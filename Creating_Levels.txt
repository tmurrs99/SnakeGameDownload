Each level has a little block that is labeled. You guys just have to plug in some code.
Here is what you can control:
-where the obstacles are
-where the turrets are, how often they shoot, and which direction they shoot in
-where the first piece of food is
-how much food you must eat to beat the level
-where you spawn

Note: dont spawn two objects in the same location
Note: the outer ring is occupied by obstacles so the grid goes from 1-23, inclusive

THe first thing you have to edit is this:
player = new Snake(theEnv, new Location(5,10));
     -you guys will change the numbers in Location(5, 10) to the spawn location you want, and only those numbers
     - i.e. you could make it say: player = new Snake(theEnv, new Location(10,10));
     -(its in row,column form. Just like a matrix/ 2D array. This is the same forany other time you see Location(r, c))
     -(this grid is square and goes from 0 to 24, you can place objects in spaces 1-23 due to the fact that the grid is bounded)
     -you will also have to plug the same numbersyou did before into the line:
           theEnv.add(new SnakePart(theEnv, new Location(5,10)));
     
THe next thing is:
ent3.add(new Food(theEnv, new Location(20, 20)));
     -here yoou will plug in the location for the food

And then you will spawn obstacles,
you will simply copy and paste this line:
theEnv.add(new Obstacle(theEnv, new Location(17,17)));
      -you will then just change the location
      -you have to recopy this line for each obstacle you spawn, changing the location each time
      
then you will spawn turrets
copy and paste this line:
ent2.add(new Turret(theEnv, new Location(10,1), Direction.EAST, 4));
     - first you must make sure that the number after "ent" matches the level number
     -then you must chang the location
     -then the direction is the next parameter.
     -the next number is the fire delay. THis number minus 1 will always be the amount of leeway the snake
     has when passing through turret fire.
     
And lastly,
you change this line:
Level level2 = new Level(theEnv, true, ent2, 7, score);
     -make sure that the level matches your level.
     - then only change the fourth parameter to the amount of food that should be required to be eaten to
     pass the level.
